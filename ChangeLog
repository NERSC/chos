	* 0.11.2 release

	* kernel/chos_lkm.c: Modify the behavior of chos_do_fork to
	explicitly set the CHOS link of new processes to match that of the
	parent process.  do_fork() copies the original process, wakes up the
	new process, and then returns.  This means that there is some amount
	of time where the new process is awake but the real do_fork() has
	not yet returned.  This change should prevent some scenarios
	identified by Doug Jacobsen of NERSC where the child process forks
	its own child process and then exits before its CHOS link is set,
	resulting in the newest child process not receiving the correct CHOS
	link mapping.
